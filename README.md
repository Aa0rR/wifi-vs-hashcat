# Wifi vs hashcat
                                                                                                                          
Hi and welcome to the **WPA/WPA2 WiFi vs hashcat** script .
This is the result of the automation of David Bombal’s video:

My philosophy is to automate as many instructions as possible to get to the maximum of the result with the least effort. Technology and everything that is part of it must be simple for its user, otherwise it loses its greatest meaning: that of simplifying life to people


## Installation

Run the **install.sh** file with sudo privilanges. 
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/wifi-vs-hashcat]
└─$ sudo ./install.sh
```
## Starting the script

Once you install all the requirements from the install script you can easly start the analysis and cracking script named **start.sh**.
```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/wifi-vs-hashcat]
└─$ sudo ./start.sh
```
## Execution

Now follow the instructions proposed to you to achieve the final result!

### Happy Cracking!
